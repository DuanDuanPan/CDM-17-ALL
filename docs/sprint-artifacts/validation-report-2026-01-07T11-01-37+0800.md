### Critical Mistakes to Prevent
Pass Rate: 2/8 (25%)

⚠ PARTIAL — Reinventing wheels  
Evidence: Story plans to reuse `useGraphTransform` for scale updates (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:333-334,380-387`) but does not reference existing reduced-motion-aware animation pattern already implemented (minimap pan animation) (`apps/web/components/graph/hooks/useMinimap.ts:50-94`).  
Impact: Dev may duplicate (or mis-implement) animation logic, increasing bug/regression risk.

⚠ PARTIAL — Wrong libraries  
Evidence: Story suggests X6 APIs accept `animation` options (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:257-276`) but X6 `Graph.zoomTo/zoomToFit/centerCell` signatures do not include `animation` (`apps/web/node_modules/@antv/x6/lib/graph/graph.d.ts:459-463,489-489`).  
Impact: TypeScript “excess property” errors + AC5 animation requirement is not achievable with the described API usage.

✓ PASS — Wrong file locations  
Evidence: File map places new code under existing graph hook/parts structure (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:390-402`).

⚠ PARTIAL — Breaking regressions  
Evidence: Shortcuts require `Cmd/Ctrl+0` and `Cmd/Ctrl+1` (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:46-55`), which are common browser-reserved shortcuts; repo already avoids `Cmd+[` in E2E because it may not reach the app (`apps/web/e2e/node-collapse.spec.ts:30-33`). Tech-spec only flags `Cmd+0` conflict, not `Cmd/Ctrl+1` (`docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:519-520`).  
Impact: Keybindings may be unreliable/impossible in browser (tab switching / page zoom), causing UX regressions and flaky E2E.

✓ PASS — Ignoring UX  
Evidence: High-fidelity mockups + positioning/states + a11y notes provided (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:80-226`).

⚠ PARTIAL — Vague implementations  
Evidence: AC5 mandates smooth animation + reduced-motion (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:66-69`) but implementation guidance relies on unsupported X6 `animation` options (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:257-276`).  
Impact: Dev lacks a correct/typed implementation path to satisfy AC5.

⚠ PARTIAL — Lying about completion  
Evidence: E2E example includes “可能需要特殊设置” placeholder for empty canvas and a non-assertive animation check (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:699-702,822-825`).  
Impact: Test plan may not actually validate acceptance criteria; “green” tests could still ship broken UX.

⚠ PARTIAL — Not learning from past work  
Evidence: Story references Story 8.1/8.2 generally (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:417-418`) but misses a key precedent: reduced-motion-aware smooth pan implemented via rAF in minimap (`apps/web/components/graph/hooks/useMinimap.ts:50-94`).  
Impact: Repeats already-solved problems and risks inconsistent motion behavior across features.

---

### Step 1: Load and Understand the Target
Pass Rate: 5/6 (83.3%)

✓ PASS — Load the workflow configuration  
Evidence: Workflow config exists (`_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story/workflow.yaml:1-32`).

✓ PASS — Load the story file  
Evidence: Story file exists with status + tech spec link (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:1-5`).

✓ PASS — Load validation framework  
Evidence: Validation framework defined (`_bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.xml:1-38`).

✓ PASS — Extract metadata (epic/story key/title)  
Evidence: Story title indicates 8.3 (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:1`).

⚠ PARTIAL — Resolve workflow variables  
Evidence: Workflow expects `sprint_artifacts` (`_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story/workflow.yaml:11-12`) but config lacks it (`_bmad/bmm/config.yaml:7-13`). Story is already located under `docs/sprint-artifacts/` (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:1`).  
Impact: Automation still relies on manual convention (story path), not resolvable variables.

✓ PASS — Understand current status  
Evidence: Status `ready-for-dev` (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:3`).

---

### Step 2.1: Epics and Stories Analysis
Pass Rate: 4/6 (66.7%)

✓ PASS — Load epics file  
Evidence: Epic 8 / Story 8.3 present (`docs/epics.md:765-823`).

✓ PASS — Epic objectives and business value  
Evidence: Epic 8 goal defined (`docs/epics.md:765-767`).

✓ PASS — ALL stories in this epic (cross-story context)  
Evidence: Stories 8.1–8.4 listed (`docs/epics.md:769-829`).

✗ FAIL — Story requirements and acceptance criteria alignment  
Evidence: Epic 8.3 AC requires `Cmd/Ctrl + 滚轮` zoom and double-click “缩放并定位” (`docs/epics.md:813-823`), but story marks `Cmd+滚轮` as out-of-scope and implements double-click as “仅平移，不改变缩放” (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:28,57-60`). Story also claims scroll-wheel zoom is implemented, but `useGraph.ts` enables zoom without modifiers (`apps/web/hooks/useGraph.ts:53-60`).  
Impact: Developer may implement behavior that contradicts the epic requirements; downstream docs/tests may diverge.

⚠ PARTIAL — Technical requirements and constraints  
Evidence: Story pins X6 version and identifies relevant hooks (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:404-411,414-418`), but the proposed X6 `animation` options are not supported (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:257-276`; `apps/web/node_modules/@antv/x6/lib/graph/graph.d.ts:459-463,489-489`).  
Impact: Implementation guidance contains API-level inaccuracies that will block development.

✓ PASS — Cross-story dependencies and prerequisites  
Evidence: Explicit integration points into existing hooks/components (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:283-334`) and references to prior stories (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:417-418`).

---

### Step 2.2: Architecture Deep-Dive
Pass Rate: 4/10 (40.0%)

✓ PASS — Load architecture file  
Evidence: Architecture defines X6 + UX constraints (`docs/architecture.md:38-41`).

✓ PASS — Technical stack with versions  
Evidence: Stack versions in project context (`docs/project-context.md:21-27`) and story pins X6 (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:404-411`).

✓ PASS — Code structure and organization patterns  
Evidence: File placement table aligns with existing `components/graph/{hooks,parts}` structure (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:390-402`; `apps/web/components/graph/GraphComponent.tsx:31-35`).

➖ N/A — API design patterns and contracts  
Evidence: No API changes in scope.

➖ N/A — Database schemas and relationships  
Evidence: No DB changes in scope.

➖ N/A — Security requirements and patterns  
Evidence: No auth/security changes described.

⚠ PARTIAL — Performance requirements and optimization strategies  
Evidence: Story targets 500–5000+ nodes (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:16`), but does not capture performance risks/guardrails (tech-spec flags `zoomToFit` contentBBox cost at 1000+ nodes: `docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:521-521`).  
Impact: “Fit to screen” may be slow or janky on large graphs without mitigation/measurement plan.

⚠ PARTIAL — Testing standards and frameworks  
Evidence: Tests are specified (Vitest + Playwright) (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:335-347,421-430`), but E2E example does not match repo harness (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:670-675`; `apps/web/e2e/testUtils.ts:33-37`) and includes weak assertions (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:822-825`).  
Impact: E2E may be flaky/failing and not validate core UX.

➖ N/A — Deployment and environment patterns  
Evidence: No deployment changes in scope.

✓ PASS — Integration patterns and external services  
Evidence: Integrates via existing graph hooks (`useGraphHotkeys`, `useGraphTransform`) (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:283-334,380-387`).

---

### Step 2.3: Previous Story Intelligence
Pass Rate: 3/7 (42.9%)

✓ PASS — Load previous story file  
Evidence: Prior stories referenced as implementation precedents (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:417-418`).

⚠ PARTIAL — Dev notes and learnings  
Evidence: Has local TD notes (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:352-387`) but does not capture key learnings from prior implementations (e.g., rAF-based motion handling in minimap) (`apps/web/components/graph/hooks/useMinimap.ts:50-94`).  
Impact: Repeats solved problems and risks inconsistent patterns.

⚠ PARTIAL — Review feedback and corrections needed  
Evidence: No “prior review feedback / pitfalls” section (contrast with Story 8.2’s explicit pitfalls section).  
Impact: Misses known issues that could prevent regressions.

✓ PASS — Files created/modified and their patterns  
Evidence: File map list (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:390-402`).

⚠ PARTIAL — Testing approaches that worked/didn’t  
Evidence: Test plan exists but does not reference existing Playwright conventions (`gotoTestGraph`) or keybinding caveats from prior tests (`apps/web/e2e/testUtils.ts:33-37`; `apps/web/e2e/node-collapse.spec.ts:30-33`).  
Impact: Test approach may not align with current repo practice.

⚠ PARTIAL — Problems encountered and solutions found  
Evidence: Story includes an empty-canvas note for implementation (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:49-51,253-256`) but does not capture known constraints (browser shortcut conflicts, X6 API limitations).  
Impact: Key blockers may be discovered late during implementation.

✓ PASS — Code patterns and conventions established  
Evidence: Explicit reuse of existing hooks (`useGraphTransform`, `useGraphHotkeys`) (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:283-334,380-387`).

---

### Step 2.4: Git History Analysis
Pass Rate: 0/5 (0.0%)

⚠ PARTIAL — Files created/modified in previous work  
Evidence: Story has no commit references; only doc/code pointers (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:412-418`).  
Impact: Recent patterns or refactors may be missed.

⚠ PARTIAL — Code patterns and conventions used  
Evidence: No git history citations (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:412-418`).  
Impact: Implementation may diverge from latest conventions.

⚠ PARTIAL — Library dependencies added/changed  
Evidence: No commit-based dependency rationale; only static version table (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:404-411`).  
Impact: Missed context for why certain libs/versions are chosen.

⚠ PARTIAL — Architecture decisions implemented  
Evidence: No commit references or “latest state” notes (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:412-418`).  
Impact: May miss recent architectural shifts.

⚠ PARTIAL — Testing approaches used  
Evidence: No commit references for test conventions (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:421-430`).  
Impact: E2E might not match current harness patterns.

---

### Step 2.5: Latest Technical Research
Pass Rate: 1/4 (25.0%)

✓ PASS — Identify libraries/frameworks mentioned  
Evidence: X6 + hooks explicitly specified (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:404-411`).

⚠ PARTIAL — Breaking changes or security updates  
Evidence: Versions are listed but no release notes/changelog references (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:404-411`).  
Impact: Compatibility risks may be missed.

⚠ PARTIAL — Performance improvements or deprecations  
Evidence: No external research cited for large-graph zoom behavior (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:16,404-411`).  
Impact: Implementation may be suboptimal on 1k–5k nodes.

⚠ PARTIAL — Best practices for current versions  
Evidence: No pointer to official X6 zoom/transform best practices; story relies on unsupported `animation` options (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:257-276`).  
Impact: Dev may ship incorrect API usage.

---

### Step 3.1: Reinvention Prevention Gaps
Pass Rate: 1/3 (33.3%)

⚠ PARTIAL — Wheel reinvention  
Evidence: Motion is already implemented in minimap via rAF (`apps/web/components/graph/hooks/useMinimap.ts:59-94`), but story does not reference it and instead suggests `animation` options (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:257-276`).  
Impact: Duplicated motion logic and inconsistent reduced-motion behavior.

⚠ PARTIAL — Code reuse opportunities not identified  
Evidence: `useGraphTransform` already tracks `scale` (`apps/web/components/graph/hooks/useGraphTransform.ts:40-56`), yet story also introduces `currentZoom` from graph into `useZoomShortcuts` (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:242-247,331-334`).  
Impact: Duplicate sources of truth for zoom may cause bugs and unnecessary rerenders.

✓ PASS — Existing solutions not mentioned  
Evidence: Story explicitly references existing hooks and integration points (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:283-334,414-418`).

---

### Step 3.2: Technical Specification DISASTERS
Pass Rate: 0/5 (0.0%)

⚠ PARTIAL — Wrong libraries/frameworks  
Evidence: Story assumes X6 zoom APIs provide animation (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:66-69,257-276`), but X6 Graph signatures omit `animation` (`apps/web/node_modules/@antv/x6/lib/graph/graph.d.ts:459-463,489-489`).  
Impact: Implementation blocked by TS typing and missing animation support unless redesigned (rAF/scroller transition).

➖ N/A — API contract violations  
Evidence: No API changes in scope.

➖ N/A — Database schema conflicts  
Evidence: No DB changes in scope.

➖ N/A — Security vulnerabilities  
Evidence: No security/auth changes in scope.

⚠ PARTIAL — Performance disasters  
Evidence: Large-graph target stated (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:16`) and tech-spec flags `zoomToFit` cost on 1000+ nodes (`docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:521-521`), but story lacks mitigation/guardrails.  
Impact: Fit-to-screen could become a P95 interaction regression on large graphs.

---

### Step 3.3: File Structure DISASTERS
Pass Rate: 2/4 (50.0%)

✓ PASS — Wrong file locations  
Evidence: File placement table (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:390-402`).

⚠ PARTIAL — Coding standard violations  
Evidence: ZoomIndicator sample uses raw `<button>` and `cn(...)` without aligning to repo UI primitives (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:169-187`). Repo guideline centralizes Button usage in `@cdm/ui` (project context: `docs/project-context.md:149-152`; minimap toggle uses `Button` from `@cdm/ui`: `apps/web/components/graph/parts/MinimapToggleButton.tsx:13-15`).  
Impact: Inconsistent UI composition and potential style drift.

✓ PASS — Integration pattern breaks  
Evidence: Hook and part export updates are explicitly listed (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:279-280,329-334`).

➖ N/A — Deployment failures  
Evidence: No deployment changes in scope.

---

### Step 3.4: Regression DISASTERS
Pass Rate: 1/4 (25.0%)

⚠ PARTIAL — Breaking changes  
Evidence: Story adds keybindings that may conflict with browser shortcuts (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:46-55`) and does not provide feasibility fallback; only input-protection is mentioned (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:292-292`).  
Impact: Users may lose expected browser behavior or shortcuts may never fire.

⚠ PARTIAL — Test failures  
Evidence: E2E example uses `page.goto('/')` and `Meta+0/1` (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:670-689`), but repo E2E uses `gotoTestGraph` (`apps/web/e2e/testUtils.ts:33-37`) and avoids `Cmd` shortcuts (`apps/web/e2e/node-collapse.spec.ts:30-33`). Input protection test clicks a dialog-only input that is not in DOM unless opened (`apps/web/components/CommandPalette/GlobalSearchDialog.tsx:161-162`).  
Impact: E2E tests likely flaky or failing; input-protection scenario not properly set up.

✓ PASS — UX violations  
Evidence: UX/a11y details are specified (indicator placement/states, aria-label) (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:80-226,169-186`).

⚠ PARTIAL — Learning failures  
Evidence: Prior stories referenced but key learnings (motion implementation + keybinding caveats) not incorporated (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:417-418`; `apps/web/components/graph/hooks/useMinimap.ts:50-94`; `apps/web/e2e/node-collapse.spec.ts:30-33`).  
Impact: Likely repeat of earlier “shortcut doesn’t reach app” pitfalls.

---

### Step 3.5: Implementation DISASTERS
Pass Rate: 1/4 (25.0%)

⚠ PARTIAL — Vague implementations  
Evidence: Story and tech-spec disagree on API naming (`centerNode` vs `zoomToNode`) (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:242-246`; `docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:154-163`). Animation implementation also relies on unsupported options (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:257-276`).  
Impact: Ambiguity + incorrect API assumptions increase implementation churn.

⚠ PARTIAL — Completion lies  
Evidence: E2E includes unfinished empty-canvas setup and weak assertions (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:699-702,822-825`).  
Impact: Risk of declaring completion without real AC verification.

✓ PASS — Scope creep  
Evidence: Clear in/out scope boundaries (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:20-31`).

⚠ PARTIAL — Quality failures  
Evidence: Animation requirement is not backed by a strong test oracle (E2E check is trivial) (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:806-826`).  
Impact: Animation/regression issues may ship undetected.

---

### Step 4: LLM-Dev-Agent Optimization Analysis
Pass Rate: 1/5 (20.0%)

⚠ PARTIAL — Verbosity problems  
Evidence: Story includes large inline code blocks for unit/comp/E2E tests (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:433-587,596-658,666-903`).  
Impact: Token-heavy story may reduce dev agent effectiveness and increase missed details.

⚠ PARTIAL — Ambiguity issues  
Evidence: Naming mismatch (`centerNode` vs `zoomToNode`) (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:242-246`; `docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:154-163`).  
Impact: Developer may implement wrong function names / mismatched wiring.

⚠ PARTIAL — Context overload  
Evidence: Full tests + UI spec + tokens are included, some of which can be referenced rather than embedded (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:80-226,433-903`).  
Impact: Critical signals are harder to find.

⚠ PARTIAL — Missing critical signals  
Evidence: Story does not clearly call out browser shortcut feasibility risks; only tech-spec mentions `Cmd+0` conflict (`docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:519-520`). Also does not call out X6 lack of animation options despite requiring AC5 (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:66-69,257-276`).  
Impact: Key implementation blockers discovered late.

✓ PASS — Poor structure  
Evidence: Phased tasks + file map + test matrix are clear (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:229-430,390-402,907-920`).

---

### Step 4: LLM Optimization Principles
Pass Rate: 1/5 (20.0%)

⚠ PARTIAL — Clarity over verbosity  
Evidence: Long inline test listings add noise (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:433-903`).  
Impact: Harder to identify the minimum set of “must implement” steps.

⚠ PARTIAL — Actionable instructions  
Evidence: Some instructions are actionable but rely on incorrect API assumptions (X6 `animation`) (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:257-276`; `apps/web/node_modules/@antv/x6/lib/graph/graph.d.ts:459-463`).  
Impact: Dev agent will attempt code that does not type-check.

✓ PASS — Scannable structure  
Evidence: Tables + headings + phased tasks (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:155-226,229-348,390-402`).

⚠ PARTIAL — Token efficiency  
Evidence: Large code blocks could be reduced to key assertions and file paths (contrast Story 8.2 validation passing token efficiency).  
Impact: Increased chance of truncation/missed details in limited-context runs.

⚠ PARTIAL — Unambiguous language  
Evidence: Shortcut feasibility and exact behavior diverge from epic (`docs/epics.md:813-823`; `docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:28,57-60`).  
Impact: Conflicting instructions across artifacts.

Evidence: Addressed in “Recommendations” section below (per checklist `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story/checklist.md:213-218`).

---

## Failed Items
- ✗ Epic/story acceptance criteria mismatch: `Cmd/Ctrl+滚轮` and “双击缩放并定位” vs story “Cmd+滚轮 out-of-scope” + “双击仅平移” (`docs/epics.md:813-823`; `docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:28,57-60`).

## Partial Items
- X6 API usage assumes `animation` options that are not in the typings (likely TS errors) (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:257-276`; `apps/web/node_modules/@antv/x6/lib/graph/graph.d.ts:459-463,489-489`).
- Browser shortcut feasibility risks for `Cmd/Ctrl+0/1` are not fully addressed (tech spec only flags `Cmd+0`) (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:46-55`; `docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:519-520`).
- E2E plan does not match repo harness (`gotoTestGraph`) and uses Meta keys; input protection test does not open the dialog before interacting (`docs/sprint-artifacts/story-8-3-zoom-shortcuts-system.md:670-689,881-900`; `apps/web/e2e/testUtils.ts:33-37`; `apps/web/components/CommandPalette/GlobalSearchDialog.tsx:161-162`).
- Missing reuse of existing reduced-motion-aware animation precedent (`apps/web/components/graph/hooks/useMinimap.ts:50-94`).
- Workflow config variable `sprint_artifacts` missing in `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` (automation fallback required) (`_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story/workflow.yaml:11-12`; `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml:7-13`).

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix:
   - Resolve Epic 8.3 mismatch: either update `docs/epics.md` to reflect the final UX decisions (double-click center-only, no Cmd+wheel) or update story AC/scope to match the epic.
   - Replace unsupported X6 `animation` option guidance with a real approach (reuse rAF pattern like `useMinimap` or explicitly adopt scroller transitions) and update test expectations accordingly.
   - Rewrite Playwright plan to match repo conventions (`gotoTestGraph`, avoid Meta shortcuts, open search dialog before interacting).
2. Should Improve:
   - Add explicit note about browser-reserved shortcuts and define fallback bindings (and which ones to test in Playwright).
   - Remove duplication: prefer `scale` from `useGraphTransform` as the single zoom source of truth; avoid `currentZoom` in `useZoomShortcuts` unless necessary.
3. Consider:
   - Add performance guardrails/metrics for `zoomToFit` on 1k–5k nodes (timing budget, sampling plan, optional debounce/idle scheduling).
   - Reduce story token weight by keeping only key assertions/snippets and linking to existing code patterns where possible.
