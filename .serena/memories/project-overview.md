# Project Overview

## Project Name
CDM-17-cc (脑图驱动协同研发平台 / Mind Map-Driven Collaborative Development Platform)

## Purpose
A collaborative B2B SaaS platform where mind maps serve as the single source of truth (SoT) for:
- Requirements management
- Task execution and workflow orchestration
- Knowledge sharing
- Approval processes
- Real-time team collaboration

The platform enables seamless transition from concept to delivery within a single visual workspace, designed for large-scale engineering projects (aerospace, telecommunications, enterprise software).

## Key Features (MVP Scope)
- **Mind Map as Core Interface**: Multi-layout support (free-form, tree, logical), with 1k+ nodes support
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-cursor, conflict detection, <200ms sync latency
- **Execution Engine**: Task mapping, FS/SS/FF/SF dependencies, approval-driven workflow automation
- **Security & Compliance**: Multi-level classification (field/attachment/node-level permissions), dynamic watermarks, audit trails (1+ year retention)
- **Notification System**: Smart throttling (5-min deduplication/aggregation), priority channels
- **Performance Baseline**: 1k+ nodes, 50 concurrent users, P95 interaction <100ms

## Target Users
- Project/System Engineering Managers
- R&D/Architecture/Testing teams
- Security & Compliance officers
- Target scenarios: Multi-team collaboration, classified/tiered access, cross-disciplinary projects

## Project Status
- **Current Phase**: Solutioning (greenfield project)
- **Completed Phases**:
  - ✅ Research (Milanote competitive analysis)
  - ✅ Product Brief
  - ✅ Product Requirements Document (PRD)
  - ✅ UX Design Specification
  - ✅ Architecture Decision Document
- **Next Steps**:
  - Create Epics & Stories
  - Test Design
  - Implementation Readiness Check
  - Sprint Planning

## Development Approach
Using **BMAD (Behavior-Modeled Adaptive Development)** methodology with greenfield track. The project follows a structured workflow through Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation phases.

## Documentation Language
Primary documentation is in **Chinese (Simplified)**.
